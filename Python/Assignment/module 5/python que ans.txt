1) what is meaning of recursion ?
-> When function calls it self is called Recursive function and this technique known as Recursion.

2) what is meaning of keywwords and how many keywords are there?
-> Keyword is reserved word which have predefind meaning.(int,float,for,print)
-> there are 32 keyword.

3) What are the constarint for variable declaration?
-> Variable name does not contain white space.
-> Variable name can't start with digit.
-> Variable name can contain A-Z digit.
-> we can't use any reserved word as a variable name.

4) Difference Between For loop and While Loop.
-> For loop is sequence control loop.
-> While loop is a entry control loop.

5) How many types of functions?
-> There are two types of function.
1. built-in function.
2. user defined function.

6) What is Function?
-> Function is a block of code that we used again and again.

7) why we used function?
->  Reduce our code.

8) Write the categories of Functions?
-> function with parameters and function with return type.
-> function with parameters and function without return type.
-> function without parameters and function with return type.
-> function without parameters and function without return type.

9) Difference Between Parameters and return values.
-> parameters means that value which pass at function definition time.
-> Return value means result of function execution time. 

10) What is the meaning of parameters and arguments?
-> parameter means that value which pass at function defination time.
-> arguments means thet value which pass at function calling time.

11) Difference beetween arrays and structures?
-> Array can contain only similar elements.
-> Structure can contain similar and dis-similar elements.

12) What is meaning of type casting?
-> Type casting maens - to convert one data type value into another data type.

13) When we use break and continue satement?
-> Break statement stops the entire process of the loop.
-> Continue statement only stop the current iteration of the loop.

14) What are the conditional statements?
-> They perform some condition according to the requirement of the client/user.
1. If condition
2. If else condition
3. Nested if condtion
4. Else if condition
5. Switch Case

15) Difference between conditional statement and conditional operator?
-> Condition statement which is based on different different condition(if,if else, nested if, else if,switch)
-> conditional operator which is divided in 3 expression.(ternary operator)
 exp1 ? exp2 : exp3:
exp1 is true execute exp2
exp1 is false execute exp3
