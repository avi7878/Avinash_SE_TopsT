1) Why Django should be used for web-development ?

Ans - Django is the best framework for web applications, as it allows developers to use modules for faster development. As a developer, you can make use of these modules to create apps, websites from an existing source. It speeds up the development process greatly, as you do not have to code everything from scratch.


-> Explain how you can create a project in Django?
Ans - 
To create the project:
1 : Open a command shell (or a terminal window), and make sure you are in your virtual environment.
2 : Navigate to where you want to store your Django apps (make it somewhere easy to find like inside your Documents folder), and create a folder for your new website (in this case: django_projects).

-- Open a command shell and install django 
	-- pip install Django

-- Create a project Directory.

-- Create a Django Project.
	-- django-admin startproject <projectname>

-- migrate
	-- python manage.py migrate

-- Create a Superuser
	-- python manage.py createsuperuser

-- staret the server 
	-- python manage.py runserver
